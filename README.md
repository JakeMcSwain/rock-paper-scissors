This is an attempt to create the javascript behind a rock paper scissors game. Tied to the Odin Project's curriculum. This game will be played entirely within the console.


This project was more difficult than initial thought. I had to rely on other student solutins then troubleshooting where it didnt make sense. Ultimately, I eneded up making some changes that I probably didnt have to. Ideally I would have kept or statements to make things quicker and easier but this works well now.x
